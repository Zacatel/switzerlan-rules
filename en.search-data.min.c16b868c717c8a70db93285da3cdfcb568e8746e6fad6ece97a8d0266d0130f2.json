Each team must play in their own lobby. Upon entering the lobby the players must immediately send their match link to a tournament administrator. SV2 is the effective scoring used. The advancing teams will be determined by adding the combined normalized team scores accross the whole qualifier pool and comparing it to the other teams. The top 16 teams will advance.

Instead of having a strict amount of maps per mod and per stage we opted to focus on skillsets first and on forced mods secondary. This means that a map such as nomod 5, which historically has been associated with nomod speed, may also be a doubletime map.\nWe have also opted to replace all the nomod maps by freemod maps. Players may choose any or multiple of the following mods: nomod, hidden, hardrock unless otherwise specified. HR is generally disallowed in reading picks, which will be noted on the mappool sheet.\nPlayers are not forced to pick a mod in the FM mappool.

This tournament will be fully self reffed until the Grand Finals.\nRoll and warmups (Brackets only) # At the beginning of a match, the captain of each team executes a !roll command.\nThe team with the highest roll points will have their warmup played first.

The qualifier score of a map is determined by the scores submitted to the /mp/ link. A player’s score is counted as long as he does not quit during the map. If a map is played on the wrong settings e.g. wrong mod or score system, it will be replayed.\nLobby behaviour # Behaviour during and between matches underlies the global osu! and switzerLAN rules. Players are expected to be respectful to staff and to each other during matches.

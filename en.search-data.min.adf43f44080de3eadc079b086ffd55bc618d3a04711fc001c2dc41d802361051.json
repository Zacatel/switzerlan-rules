The teams will play in self reffed lobbies. Each team must play in their own lobby. Upon entering the lobby the players must immediately send their match link to a tournament administrator. In osu!lazer the match link can be found on your profile inside the \u0026ldquo;multiplayer\u0026rdquo; tab at the top.

Instead of having a strict amount of maps per mod and per stage we opted to focus on skillsets first and on forced mods secondary. This means that a map such as nomod 5, which historically has been associated with nomod speed, may also be a doubletime map.\nWe have also opted to replace all the nomod maps by freemod maps. Players may choose any or multiple of the following mods: nomod, hidden, hardrock unless otherwise specified. HR is generally disallowed in reading picks, which will be noted on the mappool sheet.\nPlayers are not forced to pick a mod in the FM mappool.
